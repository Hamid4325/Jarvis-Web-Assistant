# Jarvis Web Assistant

Jarvis Web Assistant is a smart, web-based personal assistant built using **Python**. It leverages the power of the **Mistral API** to provide human-like responses and assist users with daily tasks directly from the browser.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌐 Web interface for easy interaction
- 🧠 Human-like conversational responses using Mistral API
- ✅ Task handling and query responses
- 🔧 Lightweight and beginner-friendly design
- 💬 Real-time conversation experience

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **API**: Mistral (for AI-generated responses)

## 🖥️ How It Works

1. User types a query in the web interface.
2. The query is sent to the Python backend.
3. Python interacts with the Mistral API and fetches a response.
4. The response is displayed back on the web interface in real-time.


## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Add voice input/output capabilities
* Expand task handling (calendar, reminders, to-do lists)
* Support for plugins and additional APIs
